# Typing Tomes
Typing Tomes is a single-page HTML app to practice typing on books. You create a profile, and then upload a book (an ePub) and you are good to go. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use and install.

# How to install
Just download the HTML file and open it in the browser of your choice. 

# Creating a profile and adding books
It is really pretty self-explanatory. When you first start it, you are asked to create a profile. Just enter a name and press *Save and Start*. 
You will start in the *My Library* area. Press *Add Book* and it will open a dialogue to let you add an ePub, which you can select from the folder on your computer or just drag and drop on the space. 
Once you do this it will open your ePub and a dialogue for you to choose what you want to practice typing on or not. Books will have all manner of extras like an *Introduction*, an *Author's Note*, *Table of Contents*, and so on. Select the ones you want and when done, press *Save Book to Library*. Note that this also works well for short story collections.

Your ebook will now appear in the library. A book is attached to a profile so if you create more than one profile, each person's books will be separate. If you delete a profile, the books will also be deleted, however only for that profile.

# Typing a book
Once you open a book to start typing you will see a screen like this:

The app will track your live typing speed as you type as well as the accuracy, it is reset for each paragraph, and the clock only starts once you start typing a new paragraph. There is a drop-down menu to change chapters/sections.

These are shortcuts for the typing experience. To end a paragraph and go to the next one, press *Enter* at the end. If you want to start over midway, just press *Tab*, and if you want to skip a paragraph, just press *Shift+Enter*. Lastly, if you want to go back and redo a previous paragraph again then press *Shift+Tab*.

As you finish, each paragraph will be measured and entered into the histogram at the bottom. The results are unique for each book.

At the very bottom, you will notice two buttons on the left and right. *Library* returns you to the library to upload or change books.  *Settings* lets you change the font or its size.

I hope you find the app useful and fun.

Cheers!
