# Typing Tomes
Typing Tomes is a single-page HTML app to practice typing on books and target your typing weaknesses. It is meant to help you improve and stay motivated, while enjoying a cool book at the same time. Win-win-win IMHO. You create a profile, and then upload a book (an ePub) and you are good to go. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use and install.

*(Note: The addition of visual themes and now metrics to help you track your progress and time spent practicing may break your profile from previous versions. If this happens, just delete it and create a new one.)*

# List of features

- Import any epub to type on
- Live WPM and accuracy
- Daily Goal bar to keep you motivated (and on track)
- Histogram with bar charts of your performance in the book (WPM and accuracy)
- Single page report with various stats (WPM in last 30 days, number of words, consecutive days of practice, etc), chart of your daily practice, bar chart of your weekly performance
- n-gram analysis of your typing: it identifies your weakest bigrams (2-letter sequences like _th_, _st_, etc.) and trigrams (3-letter sequences)
- Drills so you can train your weaknesses and improve
- Lot of colorful themes/skins

# How to install or use
To use it you can simply click on this link: **_[Typing Tomes](asilver.github.io/Typing_Tomes/)_**, or you can just download the single HTML file (156 kb as of this writing) and open it in the browser of your choice.

# Creating a profile and adding books
It is really pretty self-explanatory. When you first start it, you are asked to create a profile. Just enter a name and press *Save and Start*.

You will start in the *My Library* area. Press *Add Book* and it will open a dialogue to let you add an ePub, which you can select from the folder on your computer or just drag and drop on the space. 
Once you do this it will open your ePub and a dialogue for you to choose what you want to practice typing on or not. Books will have all manner of extras like an *Introduction*, an *Author's Note*, *Table of Contents*, and so on. 

<img width="534" height="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa691df-7320-464a-900b-1dbec556a32c" />

Select the ones you want and when done, press *Save Book to Library*. Note that this also works well for short story collections. Your ebook will now appear in the library.

<img width="874" height="531" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e433bd6-e426-49d2-999b-2a45d2f27cdc" />

A book is attached to a profile so if you create more than one profile, each person's books will be separate. If you delete a profile, the books will also be deleted, however only for that profile.

# Typing a book
Once you open a book to start typing you will see a screen like this:

<img width="869" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285ee759-25a0-4277-af93-0c19105b849a" />

The app will track your live typing speed aandaccuracy while you type, and has a Daily Goal bar that fills in as you practice. The default is 30 minutes but you can change that in the settings. The text starts dark and become bright as you proceed, but you can also invert that to light text becoming dark in the settings.

<img width="851" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6e86fd7-16e8-4bae-ad7e-b1fca5a5e135" />

Just type and when you reach the end of the paragraph press Enter to start the next one. The clock only starts once you start typing a paragraph, so when you press Enter, the clock is stopped until you begin the new one. There is a drop-down menu to change chapters/sections.

<img width="699" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8707c819-50ec-4d1d-b040-312f3241ed4f" />

There are shortcuts for the typing experience. To end a paragraph and go to the next one, press *Enter* at the end. If you want to start over midway, just press *Tab*, and if you want to skip a paragraph, just press *Shift+Enter*. Lastly, if you want to go back and redo a previous paragraph again then press *Shift+Tab*.

As you finish, your performance and time spent will be measured and entered into the reports section. The results are unique for each book.

# Reports

At the top there is a navigation bar to switch between areas: Library - Typing - Reports - Settings. 

<img width="599" height="75" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdd44913-b8ae-4bfc-b97d-ae520ed0713e" />

To access the reports, click on Reports.

<img width="861" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5363fc-565d-4d1a-b305-d5925b0733be" />

There are two main report pages: the first one above shows a histogram bar chart of your typing performance on each paragraph. If you mouse over a bar, it will give you the exact numbers. At the bottom is a button called Analysis and Drills which we will look at below. At the top on the right is a large button that says Full Report, and if you click on it, it takes you to the second main report page.

<img width="868" height="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94904993-010b-47f3-b461-9f185839a5cb" />

This second page has a number of data points such as the time you have spent typing in it, the number of words, your WPM over the last 30 days, etc. There is also a streak counter to tell you how many consecutive days you have practiced. To qualify for this there is a minimum of 5 minutes. 

<img width="831" height="177" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a6fd3c5-708b-4dff-9b41-879680d72595" />

Below is a heatmap, with each square representing a day, that starts from the first day you logged a result, and the next 364 days of the year to follow. You can mouse over any of the entries to know how much time was spent. Below that is another bar chart:

<img width="804" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb491f1b-57c7-4716-881b-b7b779fe39c7" />

This bar chart shows the total WPM for a week, again starting on the week you first log a result and then for the next 51 weeks of the year to come. At the very bottom of both of these report pages is a button called **_Ananlysis and Drills_**.

# Analysis and Drills

Pressing this button under the histogram produces a report of your measured weakneses in bigrams (two-letter sequences, such as th-) and trigrams (three-letter sequences, such as -ion).

<img width="533" height="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f25988-687d-46e2-b9bc-f102ef937dca" />

It will list your five weakest and list them in order. It takes into account slowdowns as well as mistakes. You can then drill against them by pressing *Drill My Weaknesses*. The first time this requires a minimum of 200 typed words in the book typing area. Thereafter it will update to measure your last 200 words.

<img width="882" height="535" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b883755-0804-42b3-a0ef-9969af9fc375" />

The drill will produce a list of 50 words, taken from a master list of the 2000 most common words in English (2 to 10 letters long), chosen to target your bigram and trigram weaknesses. You can restart a drill at any time by pressing the _Tab_ key, the same way you can restart a paragraph in the book typing area. 

<img width="893" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b12a32c-ccad-484a-acfc-01029f37b059" />

After it is done, you can choose to redo a test on the same weaknesses by pressing *Drill More Words*, though bear in mind it will likely use many of the same words, albeit in a different order. Pressing *End Drill* will return you to the book typing area.

# Themes

In the settings panel, accessed via the settings button below the histogram, you can select the fonts, size, choose the type of typing you want, and choose one of the themes/skins included. If you aren't happy with the default theme, by all means try one of the several included. A few examples are:

<img width="865" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07f16a8-27ba-4883-aa84-e43944117c95" />

Non-conformist... and numerous others.

# Conclusion

This app really started as one designed only for my personal use, adding some metrics I found missing in other sites, but it evolved almost of its own accord (_"Wouldn't it be nice if...?"_) and some friends strongly suggested I share it. I hope you find the program useful and fun.

Cheers!

# Where to find ePub ebooks

There are plenty of sources, but the most famous is without a doubt [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). They have over 75000 ebooks from all languages and offer them in many formats including ePub.

<img width="620" height="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/409b8b98-a3f8-4632-b0c2-574541803a5a" />

For example, if you went to the page of **[Moby Dick](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701)** above and clicked on one of the epub links (preferably no images), it will download an epub copy for you to use within Typing Tomes. Easy peasy!
