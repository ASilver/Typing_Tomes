# Typing Tomes
Typing Tomes is a single-page HTML app to practice typing on books. You create a profile, and then upload a book (an ePub) and you are good to go. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use and install.

# How to install
Just download the HTML file and open it in the browser of your choice. 

# Creating a profile and adding books
It is really pretty self-explanatory. When you first start it, you are asked to create a profile. Just enter a name and press *Save and Start*. 
You will start in the *My Library* area. Press *Add Book* and it will open a dialogue to let you add an ePub, which you can select from the folder on your computer or just drag and drop on the space. 
Once you do this it will open your ePub and a dialogue for you to choose what you want to practice typing on or not. Books will have all manner of extras like an *Introduction*, an *Author's Note*, *Table of Contents*, and so on. Select the ones you want and when done, press *Save Book to Library*. Note that this also works well for short story collections.

Your ebook will now appear in the library. A book is attached to a profile so if you create more than one profile, each person's books will be separate. If you delete a profile, the books will also be deleted, however only for that profile.

# Typing a book
Once you open a book to start typing you will see a screen like this:

The app will track your live typing speed as you type as well as the accuracy, it is reset for each paragraph, and the clock only starts once you start typing a new paragraph. There is a drop-down menu to change chapters/sections.

These are shortcuts for the typing experience. To end a paragraph and go to the next one, press *Enter* at the end. If you want to start over midway, just press *Tab*, and if you want to skip a paragraph, just press *Shift+Enter*. Lastly, if you want to go back and redo a previous paragraph again then press *Shift+Tab*.

As you finish, each paragraph will be measured and entered into the histogram at the bottom. The results are unique for each book.

At the very bottom, you will notice three buttons on the left and right. *Back to Library* returns you to the library to upload or change books.  *Analysis and Drills* lets you se a report on your weaknesses (see below for more details) and train against them, and *Settings* lets you change the font or its size.

# Analysis and Drills

Pressing this button under the histogram produces a report of your measured weakneses in bigrams (two-letter sequences, such as th-) and trigrams (three-letter sequences, such as -ion). It will list your five weakest and list them in order. It takes into account slowdowns as well as mistakes.

You can then drill against them by pressing *Drill My Weaknesses*. The first time this requires a minimum of 200 typed words in the book typing area. Thereafter it will update to measure your last 200 words.

The drill will produce a list of 50 words, taken from a master list of the 1000 most common words in English, chosen to target your bigram and trigram weaknesses. You can restart a drill at any time by pressing the Tab key, just as you can restart a paragraph in the book typing area. After it is done, you can choose to redo a test on the same weaknesses by pressing *Drill more words* though bear in mind it will likely use many of the same words, albeit in a different order. Pressing *End drill* will return you to the book typing area.

I hope you find the app useful and fun.

Cheers!
